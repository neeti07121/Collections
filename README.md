# Collections

**Linked Lists Programs**

  1. **DeleteMiddleNode.java:** Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle
  2. **PartitionLinkedList.java:** Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all             nodes greater than or equal to x
  3. **RemoveDups.java:** Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
  4. **RemoveDupsPart2.java:** How would you solve the problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
  5. **ReturnKthToLast.java:** Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
  6. **SumLists.java:** You have 2 nos represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are sotred in reverse        order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked         list.
  7. **Palindrome.java:** Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
  8. **Intersection.java:** Find the intersection in two single linked list.
  9. **Loop Detection.java:**  Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.

**Stack Programs**

  10. **StackImplTemplate.java:** Algorithm to implement a Stack. A stack can be implemented using a linked list, if items were added and removed from the same side.
  11. **MyQueue.java:** Algorithm to implement queue using a linked list, if items are removed and added from different side.
